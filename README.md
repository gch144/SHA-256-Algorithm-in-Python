# SHA-256-Algorithm-in-Python




SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), of which SHA-256 is a part, is one ofthe most popular hash algorithms around. SHA-2 is known for itssecurity and its speed. In cases where keys are not generated, such asmining Bitcoin, a fast hash algorithm like SHA-2 often has the upperhand. SHA-256 is used for authenticating Debian software packages andin the DKIM message signing standard.
